This project aims at improving the lightning system for [K1 Max 3D printer](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-k1-max-3d-printer)!
I designed the lightning frame myself with [Plasticity](https://www.plasticity.xyz/), due to limited size of K1 Max, I have split the whole big model into 8 parts, then print them one by one.

In addition, there are holes to use LED bars with zip ties, no messy with double-size tapes. You gonna be surprise while cleaning a mess of double-size tapes, and I hate it.

I currently live in a mini apartment with its bathroom not having an exhaust system. This is a major issue.

In reality, it doesn't need to be said; it's very inconvenient. The landlord refuses to drill into the wall or make any repairs.

As I am unemployed and addicted to manufacturing, my products aren't particularly innovative. Yes, they are a gas air purifier. My product is nothing new at all.

But why do I create them when I could just buy one? If I don't work on simple tasks, even those that others have already done,
I'll never come up with any creative ideas or design anything better than what others have created before. And further, I won't be able to make
more complex products.

If profit is the top priority and time-saving is a goal, I'd look for something on Lazada or Shopee, and then I wouldn't be able to create anything more refined!

By the way, here are some pictures of the product. Just for fun, I designed and 3D printed it myself.

At the time of creating this product, I didn't have any measuring equipment, so I couldn't check if the concentration of methanol and ammonia in the air purifier
was accurate. I couldn't even verify if my product really solves a problem or just has a placebo effect.

I hope not, but that's how I feel about it!

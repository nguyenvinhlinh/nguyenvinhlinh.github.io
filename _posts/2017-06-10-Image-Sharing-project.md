## Introduction
Sometime in my life, I want to share something stupid anonymously, somewhere to store data anonymously. `Imgur` is good, but I am not that bad to abuse the `Imgur`, last year, they close the api to share image anonymously and I dont want to do some shit crawling stuffs or playing around with their website.I write my own image data storage. The project written in elixir with [phoenix web framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) supporting and [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). You can access the projet at [http://image.hexalink.xyz](http://image.hexalink.xyz)  

This small web application which helps you to share your images easily and quickly. Those uploading images might be stored on the system until my server storage getting full. If the server's full, images will be removed to save space.

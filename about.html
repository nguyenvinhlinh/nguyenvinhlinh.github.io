  My name is Nguyen Vinh Linh, I am the one who has a big love
  in programming. I used to be  the president of RMIT
  Vietnam IT Club. </br> </br>

  In the way learning programming, there are many knowledge
  which easy to learn but difficult to remember. This blog is
  written to solve this problem. There might be much general
  knowledge but they are all useful to note down. <br/><br/>

  The more you learn, the easier you can learn more!
